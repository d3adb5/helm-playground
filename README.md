# Moved to another repository!

This repository is no longer maintained. It will stay here for archival and
should anybody still find use for the files here, but Helm chart play will take
place in the new repository, [devops-playground][devops-playground].

# Helm Charts Playground

This repository shall contain whatever interesting thing jumps out at me when
I'm handling Helm charts here and there. It has no main focus or intent, so
don't call this a project.

# Unit Testing

Unit testing for Helm templates will be included here since every testing that
can be implemented is worth mentioning, even if it ends up being stupid simple,
as it opens doors to more useful testing.

The testing "library" that is used here is [quintush/helm-unittest][quintush].
You can install it with the following command:

```sh
helm plugin install https://github.com/quintush/helm-unittest
```

# Partial templates as functions

This understanding might apply to Go's template packages overall, but since this
repository explores Helm's capabilities, we'll speak in terms of Helm's partial
templates instead.

While implementing functions you can invoke in your templates isn't possible
through Helm, we can somewhat recreate them by defining partial templates and
making use of the limited type system that is available through the YAML spec.

This is how we recreate functions:

1. The function's name is the name of our partial template.
2. Arguments are given through the template's scope.
3. The function's return value is the text the template generates.
4. Typing is loose, and there is no static typing.
5. Parsing is made necessary if our return type is not string. 

When it comes to the funciton arguments:

1. A single argument can just be passed as the scope.
2. Positional arguments can be given as a list using the `list` constructor.
3. Named arguments can be given as a dict using the `dict` constructor.

It kinda sucks that for positional arguments you'll be using `index` quite a
bit: `index . 0`, `index . 123`. I recommend assigning values to variables:

```yaml
{{- $name := index . 0 -}}
{{- $age := index . 1 | int64 -}}
```

## Examples

Since there can't be true polymorphism, this is an attempt at an identity
function that works for any YAML object:

```yaml
{{- define "identity" -}}
  {{- toYaml . -}}
{{- end -}}

# This is how you use it:
myValues:
  {{- include "identity" .Values.someValue | nindent 2 }}

# We have to convert back from YAML to use the value as a dict
{{- if get (include "identity" .Values.someValue | fromYaml) "someKey" | eq "someString" -}}
anotherKey: "Why are you using an identity function in an if?"
{{- end -}}
```

Note that the identity function here is just `toYaml`, since we're bound to
parse YAML in the end to get actual data in our templates. Haskell programmers
rejoice, every type in YAML or that you can use with these functions in theory
has an instance for the `Read` typeclass.

This is a perhaps more interesting function that deals with numbers:

```yaml
{{- define "fibonacci" -}}
  {{- if lt . 2 -}}
    {{- printf "1" -}} # No "return" statement, sadly!
  {{- else -}}
    {{- $twoBefore := include "fibonacci" (sub . 2) | int64 -}}
    {{- $oneBefore := include "fibonacci" (sub . 1) | int64 -}}
    {{- add $twoBefore $oneBefore | printf "%s" -}}
  {{- end -}}
{{- end -}}
```

In taking a page from Oracle's book on writing documentation that is totally up
to date, I haven't tested this function, but from the looks of it it should
work. You get the picture.

You can also try and create equivalents to traditional functional glue:

```yaml
{{- define "compose" -}}
  {{- $previousOutput := last . -}}
  {{- range (initial .) -}}
    {{- $previousOutput = include . $previousOutput | fromYaml -}}
  {{- end -}}
  {{- toYaml $previousOutput -}}
{{- end -}}
```

The pseudo-function above can compose pseudo-functions that output YAML objects
/ dicts. It won't work for functions that output lists since you would need
`fromYamlArray` for those. Example usage:

```yaml
# composedValue = funcC( funcB( funcA( .Values.firstInput ) ) )
composedValue: {{ include "compose" (list "funcA" "funcB" "funcC" .Values.firstInput }}
```

This is a way to map a pseudo-function over a list:

```yaml
{{- define "map" -}}
  {{- $function := index . 0 -}}
  {{- $results := list -}}
  {{- range (index . 1) -}}
    {{- $results = include $function . | fromYaml | append $results -}}
  {{- end -}}
  {{- toYaml $results -}}
{{- end -}}
```

This is a way to replicate the OOP "builder" pattern:

```yaml
{{- define "build" -}}
  {{- $previousOutput := first . -}}
  {{- range (rest .) -}}
    {{- $template := index . 0 -}}
    {{- $firstArg := index . 1 -}}
    {{- $previousOutput = include $template (list $firstArg $previousOutput) | fromYaml -}}
  {{- end -}}
  {{- toYaml $previousOutput -}}
{{- end -}}

{{- define "withUsername" -}}
  {{- set (index . 1) "username" (index . 0) | toYaml -}}
{{- end -}}

{{- define "withPassword" -}}
  {{- set (index . 1) "password" (index . 0) | toYaml -}}
{{- end -}}

# credentials = new Credentials(.Values.credentials)
#                 .withUsername("admin')
#                 .withPassword("admin');

credentials: {{
  include "build" (list
    .Values.credentials
    (list "withUsername" "admin")
    (list "withPassword" "admin")
  )
}}
```

But please don't do it. This is just for fun. Just set your values like a
normal person would, okay?

## Sorting

You'll see in this repository implementations for the quick sort and merge sort
algorithms written as Helm partial templates. You can give it a comparison
"function" to get the ordering that you want: sort objects by a given property,
sort integers by parity, you name it. As long as your partial template yields
one of the following:

1. `LT`, for "less than".
2. `EQ`, for "equal".
3. `GT`, for "greater than".

Example usage lies in the `example-application` chart.
